# OpenCV Back-up for Traffic Signs Classification Android App

This repository provides the OpenCV library backup required for the Android application that classifies traffic signs using a pre-trained CNN model. The purpose of this repository is to host the `opencv.zip` file, which can be downloaded and integrated into the Android project for efficient image processing.

## Download

You can download the OpenCV library directly from this repository:

[Direct Download OpenCV.zip](https://github.com/nishatrhythm/OpenCV-Back-up-for-Traffic-Signs-Classification-Android-App/raw/main/opencv.zip)

_**Note**: The download may take a few moments to start, as GitHub generates a direct download link for large files._

## Usage

1. Download the `opencv.zip` file.
2. Extract it into your Android project directory.
3. Follow the instructions in the [main Android app repository](https://github.com/nishatrhythm/Android-App-of-Traffic-Signs-Classification-using-CNN) to integrate OpenCV for image processing.
